# Learn to Steer: Learning Steering Behaviors in Autonomous Systems

This repository contains the project website for "Learn to Steer: Learning Steering Behaviors in Autonomous Systems".

## Overview

This website showcases our research on learning-based steering control for autonomous systems. The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be combined with traditional control theory to create robust steering behaviors that adapt to various driving conditions.

## Website Structure

The website is built using the Nerfies template and includes:

- **Abstract**: Overview of our approach to learning steering behaviors
- **Results Carousel**: Visual demonstrations of steering performance across different environments
- **Steering Performance**: Detailed analysis of our system's capabilities
- **Adaptive Control**: Real-time adaptation to changing conditions
- **Trajectory Planning**: Advanced path planning and execution
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamic response to environmental changes

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website
2. Use `create_placeholders.html` to generate placeholder images for the project
3. Replace placeholder content with your actual research data and results

## Customization

To customize this website for your own project:

1. Update the title, authors, and affiliations in `index.html`
2. Replace placeholder images with your actual project images
3. Update the abstract and technical content
4. Modify the carousel and demonstration sections
5. Update links to point to your actual resources (papers, code, data)
